# Maintenance Log

Append-only. One short entry per wiki update, newest last.

## 2026-09-23 — Developer tooling: patch-based publishing (#4)

Added `wiki/f1-racer/tooling.md`, documenting two publishing paths: local
git clone (patch-based by construction, the default for Claude Code
sessions on this repo) and contents-API-only fallback (full-file, SHA-
gated, for shell-less sessions such as ChatGPT Work). Updated `index.md`
and `roadmap.md` to link it and to point the migrated #143/#144 references
at the current `ottobit/f1-racer` issue numbers (#3/#4) instead of the
stale `portfolio-arcade` ones. Added a short pointer in `WORK-HANDOFF.md`
so a shell-less session reads the fallback rules before writing files.
